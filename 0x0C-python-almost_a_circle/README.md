# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

<div style="text-align: justify">

Thank you for visiting this repository which contain our work to start learning Python programming. In this project, I learned about Python class inheritance. I learned about connecting three classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the unittest module to test all functionality for each class.

## Dependences 
	
> [models/base.py](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/0-read_file.py) --> File containing `Base`.This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)

> [README.md](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/README.md) ---> README file to show the project insights. 

>[__init__.py](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py) ---> with this file, the folder will become a Python package.

>[models/rectangle.py](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/2-append_write.py) ---> Class Rectangle that inherits from Base

>[models/square.py](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/3-to_json_string.py) --> Class Square that inherits from Rectangle
