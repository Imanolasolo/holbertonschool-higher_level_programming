# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

<div style="text-align: justify">

Thank you for visiting this repository which contain our work to start learning Python programming. I am learning now practicing object oriented programming.The project involved a series of quiz-like questions the answers to which I provided in single-line .txt files. The aim is to learn about mutable and inmutable objects.
